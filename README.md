# Production URL Platform

A production-style URL platform built to demonstrate modern DevOps practices end-to-end.

## What this repo demonstrates
- Containerized services with Docker
- Local orchestration with Docker Compose
- Kubernetes deployment (kind/minikube locally, EKS in AWS later)
- Helm charts with environment-specific values
- CI/CD with Jenkins (pipeline, artifacts, scanning, promotions)
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform (multi-environment)
- Configuration management with Ansible (where it fits)
- Observability: metrics, dashboards, and alerting (Prometheus/Grafana)
